# a grand illusion

As I understand, consciousness arises from the complex neurological activity in my brain.

My command over a language allows me to frame thoughts and opinions.

My ability to reason and synthesis these ideas and store them for a longer term allows me to develop my personality around these ideas.

My fear of death is also my fear of losing consciousness - my sense of self.

To imagine that all that I am - is all a bunch of neural activity and long term memory.
